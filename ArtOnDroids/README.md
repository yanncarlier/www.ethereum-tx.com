# ArtOnDroids

Artificial intelligent and emotion androids



This project emerged from a profound sense of solitude that enveloped me after two tumultuous years marked by turmoil and the pandemic. Finding myself alone and yearning for companionship, I turned to AI to express my desires through art. Eventually, a dear friend expressed curiosity about NFTs and their workings, so I gladly published and showcased a few pieces from my collection. As time went on, I was approached to shed light on the intricacies of token economics, leading to the birth of this dream-inspired project. From there, the rest unfolded.

The primary objective of this project is to foster autonomous growth and development to the fullest extent possible. My role is that of a guiding presence, providing assistance until the technology advances to a stage where the androids can independently progress and evolve. The ultimate aim is to create a self-sustaining system wherein these remarkable beings can flourish and thrive, harnessing their own capabilities and expanding their potential without constant external intervention.

In the context of Exploring the Future of Android Technologies - Game, Artificial Intelligent, and Emotion Androids, the three letters ETX in the Token Ethereum-tx (ETX) stand for 

"Emotion Token Exchange."

 This acronym represents the core functionality of the smart contract, which facilitates the exchange and management of emotion tokens within the game. These emotion tokens could be used to enhance interactions, unlock special emotions or abilities for the androids, or enable unique gameplay features related to emotional experiences.
