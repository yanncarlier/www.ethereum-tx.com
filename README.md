# EthereumTx (ETX)

**Contract Address:** `0xae6D4Def6f1D46a4A7AC257B02bC9216D13dD8e6` (Ethereum Mainnet)  
**Status:** Early-stage / unfinished project (started in Jan-01-2022)

## Overview

EthereumTx (ETX) was an experimental ERC-20 token I started building with the original idea of creating a lightweight, community-driven token tied to the concept of “paying it forward” with transaction fees or micro-rewards for on-chain activity. The project never reached a finished state and was paused indefinitely.

The token was deployed, fully minted (fixed 21 million supply), and a tiny Uniswap V2 liquidity pool was seeded (~$70) just to make it technically tradable. No marketing, no website, no socials, no roadmap—because I never got that far.

This repo and README now exist purely for transparency and as a personal archive.

## Original (Unfinished) Ideas

These were the concepts I was playing with before shelving the project:

- Emotions Token Exchange for AI economy / personality
- Potential future integration with L2s to reward cross-chain relayers

None of the above were ever implemented beyond basic thoughts.

## Current Status (November 2025)

- Project is archived and considered abandoned.
- Ownership of the contract has **not** been renounced (still held by deployer wallet).
- The pause function is currently **unpaused**; transfers work normally.
- Liquidity is minimal and was never removed—mostly just to test the deployment flow.
- No team, no treasury, no plans.

## Disclaimer

This token has no value beyond what the tiny open market decides (currently almost nothing). There is no expectation of development, support, or recovery. Treat it as an on-chain relic of an unfinished experiment.

If for some bizarre reason anyone ever wants to revive or fork this idea, feel free—just give a shout-out if you do.

That’s it. Thanks for stumbling across this little piece of crypto history.
