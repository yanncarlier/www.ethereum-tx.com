# EthereumTx (ETX)

**Contract Address:** `0xae6D4Def6f1D46a4A7AC257B02bC9216D13dD8e6` (Ethereum Mainnet)  
**Status:** Early-stage / unfinished project (started in Jan-01-2022)

## Overview

EthereumTx (ETX) was an experimental ERC-20 token I started building with the original idea of creating a lightweight, community-driven token tied to the concept of “paying it forward” with transaction fees or micro-rewards for on-chain activity. The project never reached a finished state and was paused indefinitely.

The token was deployed, fully minted (fixed 21 million supply), and a tiny Uniswap V2 liquidity pool was seeded (~$70) just to make it technically tradable. No marketing, no website, no socials, no roadmap—because I never got that far.

This repo and README now exist purely for transparency and as a personal archive.

## Original (Unfinished) Idea

This is the concept I was exploring before the project was shelved:Emotions Token Exchange (ETX) – A token designed for the emerging AI economy, specifically to represent and exchange “personality” or emotional value.The vision was to create a system where AI agents, bots, or digital personalities could earn, spend, and trade ETX as a form of emotional or experiential currency. Examples of potential use cases included:

- Tipping AI companions for meaningful interactions
- Rewarding cross-chain relayers or data providers with “emotional weight”
- Enabling AI-to-AI micro-transactions based on sentiment, empathy, or engagement quality

A significant amount of background work, writing, and prototype content was developed around this idea (mechanics, tokenomics sketches, personality scoring concepts, etc.), but none of it has been published online.The deployed contract you see today was originally just a placeholder — a simple ERC-20 minted during early testing — while the real vision remained off-chain and unfinished.

## Current Status (November 2025)

- Project is archived and considered abandoned.
- Ownership of the contract has **not** been renounced (still held by deployer wallet).
- The pause function is currently **unpaused**; transfers work normally.
- Liquidity is minimal and was never removed—mostly just to test the deployment flow.
- No team, no treasury, no plans.

## Disclaimer

This token has no value beyond what the tiny open market decides (currently almost nothing). There is no expectation of development, support, or recovery. Treat it as an on-chain relic of an unfinished experiment.

If for some bizarre reason anyone ever wants to revive or fork this idea, feel free—just give a shout-out if you do.
